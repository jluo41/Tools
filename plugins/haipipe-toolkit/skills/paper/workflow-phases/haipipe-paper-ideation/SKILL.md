# /haipipe-paper-ideation · one evergreen Paper view of an evidence-tested direction

Load `haipipe-page` first and `haipipe-page-workflow` when running the Page.
Declare `page-type: ideation`. Load `haipipe-ideation` and its
`references/manifest-and-sync.md` for an I1/I2 sync; also read
`references/receipts.md` for a final I3 handoff. The schemas stay with their
semantic owner and are not copied into this skill.

## 🧭 Journey phase

This skill is journey phase P0 Ideation of the paper journey and owns the
`page-type: ideation` reader contract below. The repo is minted WITH this Page,
so there is no entry gate and the Page may exist while every candidate is still
unverified. `haipipe-ideation` is the sole semantic owner of Direction and Idea
Cards, the I1 Generate and I2 Test state, the machine portfolio recommendation,
and the I3 human selection receipt. This Page projects those records from I1
onward; it does not regenerate them or make a second decision.

Exit through gate G0 for each selected idea only after the final handoff points
to the sole `workflow/selection.yaml`: per-claim novelty is bounded, a Task-owned
pilot or explicit waiver exists, deep venue fit uses a current Venue contract,
and the person selected the Idea plus intended target/category. The Page may
then display verdict, target, and `went to` exactly as that receipt records
them. `haipipe-paper-workflow` tests G0 from the same receipt and reciprocal
Story links; it never asks for another selection tick. The Page itself always
runs through `/haipipe-page` and `haipipe-page-workflow`
(CONTEXT → OUTLINE → EVIDENCE → CONTENT → CHECK), never a private lifecycle.

## 🔌 Semantic adapter and single authority

One evergreen `Story00-ideation` Page receives two adapter states owned by
`haipipe-ideation`:

```text
I1 GENERATE ─┐
             ├─ projection/paper-ideation-sync.yaml ─▶ same Paper P0 Page
I2 TEST ─────┘                                  revisions 1, 2, 3, ...

I3 SELECT ── workflow/selection.yaml ── handoff/paper-ideation.yaml
                                             │
                                             └─▶ verdict · target · went to
```

- `kind: paper-ideation-sync` is the working-state adapter. It carries the
  Direction, Discovery Landscape, Opportunity Map, every admitted card and
  test state, the canonical machine-only `portfolio_recommendation`, and open
  gaps. Its `selection_authority.status` remains `none`; it cannot authorize a
  Story.
- `kind: paper-ideation-handoff` is the selected-state adapter. It points to
  the latest sync plus the sole I3 selection receipt and selected Idea-target
  routes. It does not create a second portfolio or decision.
- Material Generate or Test changes increment `sync_revision` and refresh this
  same Page. The Page workflow receipt records the packet path and projected
  revision; a mismatched revision is stale, not current.
- When `paper_page.state: missing`, use `/haipipe-page` to mint or bind the one
  canonical P0 Page. When it is `blocked`, preserve the canonical path and last
  actual revision, report the named gap, and do not mint a surrogate Page or a
  second projection receipt.
- Raw Result Cards, facts, BibTeX, Task output, Venue rules, and Discovery notes
  remain with their owners. The adapter and Page carry interpretations and
  pointers only.

## 🌱 Grain and home

One Ideation Page holds ONE research direction and a dynamic number of
candidate ideas raised under it. It is the story group's PAGE ZERO (0.4.0) —
no separate group; it sits in the same group as the Stories its selected ideas
become, before them:

```text
Paper-<Slug>/
└── A1-Story/                          the story group, at the paper root (0.8.0)
    ├── Story00-ideation/              THIS PAGE · one direction, its ideas, ranked
    └── StoryA-misq-phytrait-discretion/                       what the first selected idea became:
        ├── StoryA-misq-phytrait-discretion.md                 one idea · one prospective paper blueprint
        └── outline/                   its Page workflow records
    (a second surviving idea is StoryB-<desk>-<idea-slug>/ · the letter identifies the Story)
```

**The repo precedes the Story** (0.2.0): minting a paper's Ideation Page is
what creates `Paper-<Slug>/` — as a git submodule immediately, per the
scaffold rule — with only `board.md` and `A1-Story/Story00-ideation/` inside.
The direction's name may seed the repo slug; a direction that dies leaves the
repo standing as its own record. **A board holds exactly ONE ideation page**
(the journey fixes the story group's roles, one each): a direction that
genuinely forks is a new direction, so it mints its own `Paper-<Slug>/` with
its own `Story00-ideation`, and the two pages cross-reference through the
originating row's `went to`. Two ideas from the SAME direction that both
survive are `StoryA-<desk>-<idea-slug>` and `StoryB-<desk>-<idea-slug>` in this board (0.9.0, JL 260907: the Story
letter identifies the selected Story); the `went to` cell names the Story page
by id. Before 0.5.0 a fork could take "the next free SD number"; that reading
died when the journey fixed the roles, and 0.8.0 gives the number back its
counting job at the idea level.

Historical `SD00-ideation` / `SD01-seed` instances remain readable and are not
renamed or moved merely to satisfy this contract. When such a Page is next
revised, record its canonical `Story00-ideation` / `Story<Letter>-<desk>-<idea-slug>` role and
preserve two-way links. A filesystem rename is a separate, explicitly scoped
migration, never an implicit Page or G0 action.

The page is EVERGREEN (♻️): it never closes while the direction is alive.
Ideas are cheap — generated in batches, compared, optionally ordered, and
eliminated without ceremony. There is no fixed count and no required global
winner. `Ideas (ranked)` records the current comparison/attention order; it is
not a best-to-worst truth and never substitutes for a human verdict.
What is never cheap is the row: an eliminated idea's row stays forever,
because the record is what stops the same idea being re-thought in new words
six months later.

## 🪟 Page face

The reader-facing Page keeps the base four-part shell. `Outline` and `Content`
are the two primary working surfaces, but `Opening` is required and `Aims`
remains a brief completion contract:

```text
## Opening   the direction question and why this decision needs a visible record
## Outline   the compact C/P/B · Feedback · Evidence · Supporting/Local Run projection
## Content   the discovery landscape, opportunity map, candidate Ideas, tests,
             evidence queue, and routing below
## Aims      short direction-level and Page-level done-when statements
```

Do not promote Data, Preliminary Results, Novelty Check, Feedback, Display,
States, Files, Log, or Discussion into additional top-level Page sections.
Data and preliminary results live in each Idea's Method/Minimum Experiment and
Pilot Result; Novelty Check lives under Core Claims; Journal / Venue Fit lives
inside each Idea division. Discovery Landscape and Opportunity Map are Content
divisions, not new top-level sections. Feedback/Display/Page receipts remain in
their owning Page workflow records.

Page review and Ideation selection are separate human decisions. The Page
workflow's `approved:` accepts the C/P/B Shape and its `accepted:` CHECK ruling
accepts one readable Page version. Neither selects an Idea. Only the I3
`workflow/selection.yaml` receipt can record `PROCEED`, risk-accepted `PROCEED
WITH CAUTION`, defer, or abandon and authorize a target plus `went to` Story
edge. G0 consumes that receipt and does not close this evergreen Page. Never
infer selection from Page approval, Page CHECK, comparison order, or a machine
recommendation.

## 📐 Content outline · discovery to decision

The Page makes the reasoning chain readable before it presents candidate
details: what the field establishes, what remains open, which Ideas those
openings produced, what evidence changed them, and what should happen next.
Let `K >= 1` be the number of admitted Idea Cards, including cards later
eliminated whose divisions remain as history. The number is dynamic:

```text
### 1 · Direction                         🔒 bounded question · why now · admission rule
### 2 · Discovery Landscape               🔎 direct evidence · analogues · convergence ·
                                             contradiction · unresolved territory
### 3 · Opportunity Map                   🧭 evidence-bounded openings and the Idea ids
                                             each opens, narrows, exhausts, or contradicts
### 4 · Ideas (ranked)                    🔥 one row per admitted Idea · current I1/I2/I3 state
### 5 … K+4 · Idea <n>: <title>           one division per admitted Idea, in current
                                             comparison order, using the fields below
### K+5 · Eliminated / Merged / Deferred  ♻️ permanent disposition history and reason
### K+6 · Next Evidence Queue             📮 Discovery · Task · Venue owner route per gap
### K+7 · Suggested Execution Order       ♻️ machine attention order · G0 readiness · selected
            and G0 Readiness                  Story routes only when I3 supplies them
```

The Discovery Landscape and Opportunity Map are decision-facing syntheses,
not a copied literature review. Landscape statements resolve to accepted
Discovery synthesis Pages or direct bundle evidence ids and retain direct
versus analogue status. Opportunity rows preserve the sync packet's id,
interpretation, evidence ids, affected Idea ids, and
`open | narrowed | exhausted | contradicted` status. Missing full-text depth,
counterevidence, and unresolved territory remain visible rather than being
smoothed into a novelty claim.

A retrofit Page whose single Idea already became the paper may retain its
historical nesting. On its next material revision, bind the available sync or
handoff and add only fields the source artifacts support; do not invent an I1,
I2, or I3 history.

Admission is the stable boundary. An idea becomes admitted when the semantic
layer assigns it a zero-padded `iNN` card (`i01`, `i02`, ...); from then on it
keeps one division forever.
A duplicate phrase, overbroad claim, or framing rejected before `iNN`
assignment may appear only in the disposition division with its source and reason and
does not owe a fabricated Idea division. The Page must state which kind each
eliminated row is.

## 🔎 Discovery Landscape and Opportunity Map

Division 2 answers what the field currently establishes; division 3 answers
what that evidence leaves worth pursuing. Keep the distinction visible:

```text
Discovery Landscape                         Opportunity Map
accepted evidence and its limits            Ideation's bounded interpretation
direct physician work vs analogues          one durable opportunity id
convergent signals and contradictions       evidence ids + affected Idea ids
unresolved territory and reading depth      open · narrowed · exhausted · contradicted
```

The Landscape projects `discovery_landscape` from the current sync. It may
summarize an accepted Discovery synthesis Page and direct evidence ids, but it
cannot turn an unverified source, search hit, or copied Bib entry into support.
The Opportunity Map projects `opportunity_map` without adding new openings by
Page-author intuition. When new evidence narrows or contradicts an opportunity,
the affected Idea rows and divisions change on the same sync revision.

## 📊 Ideas (ranked) · division 4

The summary table, one row per admitted Idea, every cell a state and never a
blank:

```text
id  idea                 novelty       pilot        venue fit       verdict       target       went to
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
i01 <one sentence>       partial        ✅ Result     strong · vfit   ✅ PROCEED    JAMA · Art.  StoryA-<desk>-<idea-slug>
i02 <one sentence>       ⬜ unchecked   —            ⬜ pending      ⬜ open       —            —
```

Verdict vocabulary is projected from the I3 receipt: `⬜ open`, `✅ PROCEED`,
`⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION` with named accepted risk, `❄️ DEFER`, and
`🚫 ABANDON`. Before I3 every row remains open regardless of the machine
recommendation. An abandoned, merged, or deferred Idea is also recorded in the
disposition table with its reason; its summary row and admitted Idea division
stay as history. A `—` cell
is legal only where the authoritative state makes the column moot; on a live
row every cell is a state or a bound path.

For current work, the source block names the exact
`projection/paper-ideation-sync.yaml`, `sync_revision`, Ideation task address,
Direction Card, and evidence bundle. A final selected view also names
`handoff/paper-ideation.yaml` and its `workflow/selection.yaml`. Legacy
IDEA_REPORT or `ideas.md` inputs remain readable, but a new Page does not bypass
the adapter and let ideas appear from nowhere.

The row order supports comparison and attention only. The first row is not
automatically selected, and the page may end with no selected idea, one
selected idea, or several selected ideas. The I3 human receipt and `went to`,
not position, record selection; several selected rows route to distinct Stories.
For every admitted row, `venue fit` is a state backed by its Idea × Venue Fit
Card. A selected row also names the person's target and article/category;
machine recommendations stay inside the idea division.

## 📮 Next Evidence Queue and execution order

Division K+6 groups every unresolved item by its native next owner: Discovery
for external evidence, Task for a pilot or internal fact, Venue for a current
desk contract, or Ideation for Generate/Test/Select work. Each row names the
sync gap or Idea `next_route`, the exact card or opportunity it affects, and
the Result/receipt condition that would close it. It creates no Paper-local
execution Run.

Division K+7 projects `portfolio_recommendation` as the suggested attention
order and labels it machine-authored. Before I3, G0 readiness is only a gate
reading and every verdict/target/Story cell remains open. After I3, the Page
adds only the selected routes found in the final handoff and leaves deferred or
abandoned history visible.

## 🧾 Each Idea's division · one card under evidence

One division per admitted card, titled `Idea <n>: <title>`. It projects the
card, Test Matrix, fit card, and owner receipts without rewriting their
conclusions:

```text
Origin / Opportunity            which Opportunity Map row produced or changed it
Research Question               the bounded question this Idea asks
Method                        what we actually do, 2-4 concrete steps, plain language
Hypothesis                    one sentence
Minimum Experiment            the smallest run that would show signal
Expected Outcomes             what positive, null, contradictory, and failed execution mean
Discovery Basis               direct work, analogues, convergence, contradiction, and open gap
Core Claims / Novelty Check   one line per claim plus its exact search question,
                              closest verified work, remaining delta, limitation,
                              and novel/partial/preempted/inconclusive/unverified status
                              📮 → /haipipe-novelty-check + Discovery Run/Result
Counterevidence               the strongest evidence-bound alternative or rejection
Pilot Result                  POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/WAIVED/PENDING/HOLD + the receipt
                              📮 → task-layer Run/Result, or an explicit waiver
Journal / Venue Fit           broad screen for every admitted idea; deep fit
                              for live finalists; candidate targets, article
                              type, desk risks, missing evidence, reroute,
                              current Venue contract, and machine recommendation
                              📮 → /haipipe-journal-fit
Risk                          what could sink it
Reviewer's Likely Objection   the strongest counterargument
Recommendation               the sync packet's canonical machine-only recommendation
Next Evidence Action         exact Discovery, Task, Venue, select, defer, or abandon route
```

A retrofit page fills only the fields its receipts support and marks the rest
`⬜`; inventing history is worse than a visible blank.

For retrofit novelty, split a flat Core Claims block only where the inherited
text already states distinct claims. Reuse an archived Result only when its exact
question tests the matching claim; otherwise print `unverified` and route a
new Discovery check. Do not convert one old blob-level novelty verdict into
several claim-level passes.

## 🔬 Core Claims, checked one by one

An idea is never novelty-checked as a blob. Its division states 1-5 Core
Claims that would need to be novel; each claim is checked separately and the
table's novelty cell records the Test Matrix reading supported by the worst
claim:

```text
claim → multi-source search (≥3 query shapes · recent-years window)
      → closest prior work + the delta, per claim
      → every cited prior work verified by id/DOI before it enters the page
```

The visible claim table preserves the semantic executor's fields:

```text
claim · search question · closest verified work · remaining delta · limitation · status · Result path
```

"Applying X to Y" is not novel unless the application would reveal a
surprising finding; when the method is not novel but the finding would be, the
division says so explicitly. A prior-work citation that cannot be resolved is
written `[UNVERIFIED]`, never silently trusted. (Discipline adopted from the
ARIS `novelty-check` reference and from this workspace's own
fabricated-citation incidents.)

## 🃏 The page records; it never executes

The Ideation Page is a consumer. Searching, reading, and piloting are
Task/Discovery-layer work, and their receipts are Run/Result records this page binds by
path:

```text
Direction                  ← Direction Card through paper-ideation-sync
Discovery Landscape        ← accepted Discovery syntheses + evidence ids in sync
Opportunity Map            ← Ideation interpretations + affected Idea ids in sync
Ideas + test states         ← Idea Cards + Test Matrix through sync
Core Claims lines          ← /haipipe-novelty-check + Discovery Run/Result
Pilot Result               ← /haipipe-idea-pressure-test + Task Run/Result or waiver
Journal / Venue Fit        ← /haipipe-journal-fit + Fit Card + Venue contract
Verdict · target · went to ← final handoff + sole I3 selection receipt
```

The standing semantic executor is `/haipipe-ideation`: I1 Generate authors
cards, I2 Test reconciles novelty, pressure, feasibility, and venue fit, and I3
Select owns the human receipt.
External prior-work retrieval routes through `/haipipe-discovery-search`, and
feasibility routes through the Task owner. The historical ARIS `idea-creator`
and `novelty-check` skills (Tools/references/aris) remain methodology
references: their output enters this page only after it has become an ideation
card or a discovery-/task-layer Run/Result, never by direct write.

The executor's `novel | partial | preempted | inconclusive | unverified`
vocabulary is projected without inventing a second HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW scale. Each
claim is commissioned as its own bounded Discovery question and retains its
owner-native Result lineage; the Page summarizes but does not reinterpret the
specialist receipt.

A pilot is a feasibility Result, not a paper finding: budget it small, time-box it,
and record a failed pilot as honestly as a passed one. A cell asserting a
pilot result with no Task receipt or explicit waiver behind it is a defect.

Existing regressions may be read as a retrospective pilot only through a
Task-owned Run/Result receipt that names the bounded minimum experiment, exact output
paths and execution provenance, acceptance reading, and positive/negative
result. An inherited `SKIPPED` line or manuscript claim does not satisfy G0;
it needs that retrospective receipt, a new pilot, or an explicit human waiver.

## 🎓 Projecting selected Ideas to Stories

An Idea's row may name a Story in `went to` only when the final handoff and its
sole I3 receipt establish all four:

- its Core Claims each carry a novelty reading from an independent context,
- its Pilot result binds a feasibility receipt (or records an explicit,
  reasoned waiver),
- its Venue Fit Card has a retained broad screen, complete deep fit against a
  current Venue contract, and the row names the person's intended
  target/category,
- the receipt records a person's `select` plus `proceed` or
  `proceed-with-caution`, with every accepted risk named. The Page never turns
  its machine Recommendation into the verdict, and eliminated Ideas never
  leave.

It is a two-way act: `went to` copies the exact Story path already allocated in
the receipt, normally `StoryA-<desk>-<idea-slug>`,
`StoryB-<desk>-<idea-slug>`, and so on beside this Page, or the new repo when an
Idea leaves for a different paper. That Story's C5 Source Pages and provenance
bind this Page, the final handoff, and the I3 receipt back. A row naming a Story
that does not bind back, or a Story claiming an origin this Page does not show,
is a defect on whichever side is missing.

Selection is per Idea, not per comparison table. I3 may record none, one, or
several selected candidates; every selected candidate receives one distinct
Story and passes G0 independently. The Page never declares one global best
Idea and never edits the selection receipt.

## ✋ Human authority

A machine may generate Ideas through I1, run I2 searches and pilots through
the proper owners, fill Core Claims, build Venue Fit Cards, and write the one
canonical portfolio recommendation in the sync packet. It may not author the
I3 person's identity, date, verdict, target/category, accepted risks, or Story
authorization. Selection, deferral, abandonment, targeting, and commitment are
human acts recorded once by `haipipe-ideation-select`.

Gate G0 (Ideation → Story; historical Seed wording remains readable) is tested
against each selected Idea's final handoff, its sole I3 selection receipt, and
the reciprocal Story binding. The Page summary row is a projection of those
records, not the place where another selection is minted. Paper Page workflow
receipts record projection and review only; the I3 receipt remains in the
Ideation unit.

G0 is not the Page CHECK gate. A current Page version may be accepted while no
Idea is selected, and a previously selected Story may remain valid while a
later Page version adds, defers, or eliminates other candidates.

## ✅ Closing checks

- Division 1 names one direction and what would make an idea worth a paper.
- Division 2 projects a Discovery Landscape from accepted syntheses and direct
  evidence ids without copying their Results.
- Division 3 projects the evidence-bound Opportunity Map and affected Idea ids.
- The Page Face contains Opening, Outline, Content, and Aims; Outline and
  Content are the primary working surfaces.
- Page Shape approval, Page CHECK acceptance, and the sole I3 selection receipt
  remain distinct; Paper creates no second G0 selection receipt.
- The Page names the current `paper-ideation-sync` path and revision; a stale or
  blocked sync is visible and no surrogate Page or projection receipt exists.
- The number of Idea divisions is dynamic; every admitted Idea Card has one
  retained division, filled or honestly `⬜`.
- Every disposition row states whether it is an admitted `iNN` card or a
  rejected pre-admission framing; only admitted cards owe retained divisions.
- Every row in Ideas (ranked) has no blank cell; every verdict is from the
  fixed vocabulary and comes from I3 or remains open; current work names its
  sync packet, while a legacy source is explicitly labeled legacy.
- Comparison order and the canonical portfolio recommendation are not treated
  as selection; only the I3 receipt and `went to` authorize a Story.
- Every Idea division carries the card/test fields, filled or honestly `⬜`.
- Every Core Claims / Novelty Check line traces to a per-claim Run/Result; every
  cited prior work is verified or marked `[UNVERIFIED]`.
- Every Pilot Result binds a Task Result path or an explicit waiver.
- Every admitted Idea has a broad Venue screen; every selected Idea has a
  complete deep fit, current Venue contract, and human-selected target/category.
- Every non-open human verdict projects the sole receipt's person and date.
- Every `went to` names a distinct Story that binds this page back.
- Historical SD-named instances preserve their paths unless an explicit
  migration is authorized; canonical roles and two-way bindings remain clear.
- The disposition division holds every Idea ever merged, deferred, or dropped,
  each with its reason; nothing raised has vanished.

This variant owns no scripts. The generic Page template and workflow own the
frame, plugins, receipts, and lifecycle.
