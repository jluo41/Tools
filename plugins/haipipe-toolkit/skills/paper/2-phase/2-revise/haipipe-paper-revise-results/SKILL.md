# Results Section Revision

## Overview

Use this skill for late-stage Results revision when the science is mostly stable but the writing architecture is not.
It is narrower than `haipipe-paper-draft` and `haipipe-paper-optimizer`: the job here is to repair subsection titles, bridge paragraphs, paragraph openings, and local argumentative flow.

Before you start, read the shared prose rules: `../../REF/prose-quality.md` (one idea per sentence, no em-dash, compress not split, no AI voice, <=6 sentences/paragraph, Pn.Sn markers) — all revise workers enforce them; the checks below are results-specific ADDITIONS, not replacements.

Also read the venue's results conventions from the paper's `0-lifecycle/2a-venue/2a-venue.md`: the Structural Blueprint's Results block (results reported + detail, display units) and the Writing Principles (statistical reporting, effect sizes, tables vs figures).
Fall back to the pinned `venue/playbook-*` pack only when 2a-venue.md is absent; no pack -> skip venue norms (the results-specific checks below still apply).

Use `haipipe-paper-draft` for general prose drafting or rewriting (venue style comes from the paper's `0-lifecycle/2a-venue/2a-venue.md`, with the pinned `venue/playbook-*` pack as fallback).
Use `haipipe-paper-optimizer` when the claim hierarchy, evidence chain, or figure logic is still unstable.
Use this skill when the section is largely right but still reads like stitched figure captions rather than a controlled argument.

## Quick Checks

Before revising any Results subsection, check:

1. Is the title selling the conclusion rather than the method?
2. Does the first sentence of each paragraph state that paragraph's point?
3. Are openings like `we asked`, `we examined`, or `to test this` overused?
4. Are abstract words masking a more specific noun?
5. Is the relationship to the previous paragraph explicit?
6. Is the paragraph only reporting a result, or advancing the argument?
7. Does the paragraph close by stating what changes in interpretation?
8. Does the subsection end in a way that naturally leads into the next one?

## Subsection Pattern

Each Results subsection should answer two reader questions in order:

1. Why is this analysis needed now?
2. What does it establish?

If the second question appears before the first, the subsection will feel abrupt.

The first paragraph should bridge from the previous subsection and state why the next analysis is necessary.
Later paragraphs should each do one job: sharpen a finding, separate related findings, show a consequence for evaluation or prioritization, or explain what a comparison actually distinguishes.

## Paragraph Openings

Prefer openings that either orient the reader or state a concrete result:

- `The molecular branch first showed ...`
- `The same pattern was also evident in ...`
- `A further question was whether ...`
- `Cross-representation analyses showed ...`

Avoid repeated procedural scaffolds:

- `To test this ...`
- `We next asked ...`
- `We then examined ...`

At the start of a new paragraph, avoid vague pronouns unless the referent is unmistakable.
Replace `this structure` or `that mismatch` with the explicit noun phrase.

## Style Rules

- One paragraph, one job.
- Use explicit contrasts early.
- Surface key quantitative anchors before interpretation.
- Keep the register controlled, direct, and specific.
- End each subsection with a sentence that changes the reader's expectation for the next subsection.

## Common Failure Modes

- method-like subsection titles
- first paragraphs that announce a result without a rationale
- several paragraphs in a row with the same procedural opening
- abstract nouns that blur what is actually being compared
- summary sentences that restate the result but not its implication
