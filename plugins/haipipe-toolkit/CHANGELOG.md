haipipe-toolkit — Changelog
===========================

Plugin-level rollup. Per-layer detail lives in each layer's own `skills/<LAYER>/CHANGELOG.md`. Newest first.


## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-16

Feature: endpoint lifecycle overhaul — MIMIC-IV mortality deployed to Databricks end-to-end.

### Endpoint skills (3_end/)
- **LESSON.md**: 14 lessons from MIMIC endpoint build (L1–L14), journey summary, deployment platform comparison (SageMaker vs Databricks).
- **haipipe-end/ref/0-overview.md**: three-layer builder architecture (template → project → production), deployment platform verb table (validate → upload → register → deploy → smoke test → stress test → promote), roundtrip invariant.
- **haipipe-end-meta**: inputSchema follows Databricks `dataframe_records` format, 3 builder examples in `ref/examples/` (CGM, Weight, MIMIC).
- **haipipe-end-src2input + input2src**: real-data roundtrip test REQUIRED for design/review.
- **haipipe-end-endpointset**: step 5b reproducibility check, D-prefix exclusion (160MB→14MB), three-level roundtrip enforcement.
- **haipipe-end-deploy-databricks**: platform repo link, verb-to-script mapping, MIMIC config example, gotchas (D-prefix, DATABRICKS_USER).

### Task skills (C_task/)
- **haipipe-task-for-endpoint**: renamed from haipipe-task-for-inference, C-series endpoint building scope.
- **haipipe-task-for-fit**: ExampleFn, SKIP_TRAINING parameter, step 8 reproducibility, prediction_results.json must-be-non-empty.
- **haipipe-task-for-data**: 00_develop pattern (develop→execute pairs per stage), D-prefix dictionary table exclusion.
- **haipipe-task/ref/task-lifecycle.workflow.js**: template-based task detection (data/fit/endpoint → don't modify .py).

### Data skills (1_data/)
- **haipipe-data-source**: D-prefix tables are SourceFn-only, never enter examples or payloads.

### Infrastructure
- **haipipe-qa**: new QA walkthrough skill for systematic pipeline review.


## [2.3.4] — 2026-05-31

Feature: a probe-cycle now returns 🟧 W (the next-step) as well as 🟨 K.

- **W wired into the probe-cycle.** On convergence, `haipipe-probe-loop` Step 3 files the 🟨 K, then OPTIONALLY (◇) chains `card-creator-wisdom-agent --scope <new-K>` → one per-probe 🟧 W (the probe's concrete next-step), scoped to that K. Skips cleanly when the probe implies no next-step (no fabrication).
- The W machinery (`haipipe-insight-wisdom` + `card-creator-wisdom-agent` + `invocation-modes` W row) was already correct — only the wiring was missing. The probe-cycle deliverable is now **K + W** end-to-end, so the narrative gets the claim AND the recommended next whip-crack to decide `ignite`.
- **Per-probe W** (single-K next-step, in the loop) is now distinguished from **strategic W** (across many K, stays cross-cycle).
- **Dogfooded**: confirmed probe → K01 → W01 ("param-matched FiLM re-test"); 13/13 card-reviewer-wisdom + 5/5 index-integrity gates green (independent re-run).
- Docs threaded: `06`/`00`/`07` diagrams, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md` (Q2 corrected from the stale `card-creator-data-agent` dispatch). The v2.3.3 "W is the next wiring target" caveats are now flipped to "K + W both wired". → see [skills/E_insight/CHANGELOG.md](skills/E_insight/CHANGELOG.md)


## [2.3.3] — 2026-05-31

Docs: named the end-to-end hinge between narrative-cycle and probe-cycle.

- **Claim Gap Contract** is now the explicit connector: a narrative C-slot marked `GAP`/`weak` in `claims.md` becomes the evidence contract for one probe-cycle. The contract expects K/W (K is wired now; W remains the next wiring target); the narrative re-reads K/W and records `ignite`.
- Added `diagram/v260531/07-end-to-end-claim-gap.txt` for the full ask→claim-gap→probe→K/W→cash-out workflow.
- Threaded the concept through `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, the diagram index, `skills/N_narrative/DESIGN.md`, and the narrative schema.


## [2.3.2] — 2026-05-31

Fix: a probe-cycle now files its claim as a 🟨 K card (was a 🟦 D card).

- **K sources the confirmed probe's `claim`** (not `≥1 I card`). The skill prose contradicted the schema — which already said `K sources = confirmed probe` — and a single probe-cycle could never reach K through the I-chain (I needs ≥2 D). Fixed in `haipipe-insight-knowledge`, `card-creator-knowledge-agent`, `ref/invocation-modes.md`.
- **probe-loop convergence now dispatches `card-creator-knowledge-agent`** (files the K from the claim), not `card-creator-data-agent`. The 🟦 D observations come from the probe's task-cycles; 🟩 I / 🟧 W are cross-cycle.
- **Dogfooded** on a stub project (confirmed probe → K01): all card-reviewer-knowledge gates + index-integrity passed.
- Docs threaded: `dikw-boundaries.md` (K source = confirmed probe) + `06-probe-cycle.txt` Ⓕ.
- Still pending: the `D-from-task` reconciliation (data skill still reads a probe).


## [2.3.1] — 2026-05-31

Vocabulary + a probe-cycle process doc (docs only).

- **Cycle vocabulary unified** — the three nested units are now **narrative-cycle ⊃ probe-cycle ⊃ task-cycle** (renamed from the earlier "stage / atom" mix). `L0–L3` stay as loop-level labels.
- **`diagram/v260531/06-probe-cycle.txt`** (new) — the canonical 6-step process for running ONE probe cycle (design → bridge → run×N → result → verdict → insight), its 4 gates, and the two drive modes. `02` reframed as the probe-cycle *anatomy*; `03` as the *nested cycles*; `05` renamed `roles-and-stage` → `roles-and-cycle`. Threaded through DESIGN / HANDOFF / both CHANGELOGs / probe-loop.


## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-31

The E_insight agent skeleton — E gets the `agents/` + dual-mode parity C_task and D_probe already had, with a deliberate per-type-reviewer twist.

### Highlights
- **E_insight agentified** — `agents/creators/` (4, one per DIKW layer; each a thin headless wrapper over `haipipe-insight-<layer>`) + `agents/reviewers/` (**per-type**: `card-reviewer-{data,information,knowledge,wisdom}-agent`, each enforcing that card's accuracy + boundary, plus a cross-layer `index-integrity-auditor`). A deliberate departure from C/D's type-agnostic reviewers — each DIKW card has a genuinely different boundary. → see [skills/E_insight/CHANGELOG.md](skills/E_insight/CHANGELOG.md)
- **`ref/dikw-boundaries.md`** — canonical per-layer boundary + the two promotion gates + a worked D→I→K→W example; creators follow it, reviewers enforce it.
- **Dual-mode DIKW skills** + `ref/invocation-modes.md` — the 4 filer skills run interactive OR headless (full spec → silent), chosen by input completeness.
- **Loop closure** — `haipipe-probe-loop` now dispatches `card-creator-data-agent` on convergence, filing the D card and closing the probe cycle (`probe → task → insight`) the loop previously skipped.
- **Agent registry** 13 → 22 (E adds 9: 4 creators + 5 reviewers).

### Layer changelogs touched this release
- [E_insight](skills/E_insight/CHANGELOG.md) — NEW: agent skeleton, dual-mode, per-type reviewers, dikw-boundaries


## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-31

The E_insight design + research-engine model release. **Design-only** — no new runtime skills built yet; this records the design + the mental model so the build has a stable target.

### Highlights
- **E_insight `DESIGN.md`** (`skills/E_insight/DESIGN.md`) — E finally gets the skeleton C_task/D_probe already have, applied THOUGHTFULLY (as D_probe departed from C_task): dual-mode invocation (= C_task's `ref/invocation-modes.md`), `creators/` per DIKW (the headless, agent-callable filing path), and `reviewers/` = E's unique `card-fidelity` (Codex) + `index-integrity` gates. Templates + agents NOT built yet.
- **Loop-closure finding** — `haipipe-probe-loop` never files insight: the probe cycle (`probe → task → INSIGHT`) has an empty last cell. E's headless creators are what close it; the loop is WHY filing must be headless.
- **Research-engine model, versioned** — `diagram/v260531/` (6 files): the hourglass (decompose ↓1:n / aggregate ↑n:1); the 5 roles (🥢 ask=领导/nudge · 📖 narrative=办事的人/brain · 🔧 probe=whip · ✋ task · 🧠 insight); "one stage" = one narrative turn; the probe·task·insight distillation chain. Vocabulary pinned: **whip** (挥鞭), not "wipe"; narrative is the brain (delegates execution, never runs compute).
- **HANDOFF.md** rewritten to resume from this converged model.


## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-31

The C_task "creator + reviewer agents" release: a clean split between thin per-type builder agents and shared type-agnostic reviewer gates, dual-mode skills, batch fan-out, and a notebook-bloat policy.

### Highlights
- **C_task agent families** — `creators/` (7 per-type thin builders, `code-creator-for-<type>-agent`) + `reviewers/` (2 fixed, type-agnostic gates). builder ≠ judge; the creator that writes code never reviews it. → see [skills/C_task/CHANGELOG.md](skills/C_task/CHANGELOG.md)
- **Skills renamed** `haipipe-task-<type>` → `haipipe-task-for-<type>` (7 types; router + logging unchanged), matching the `code-creator-for-<type>` naming.
- **Dual-mode skills** — one body, interactive (human steers) OR headless (agent passes a full spec → runs silent), chosen by input completeness; structured return so an agent caller can locate the scaffolded folder.
- **Knowledge centralized in `ref/`** — `authoring-conventions.md` (shared) + `invocation-modes.md` (dual-mode contract). Skills and agents both stay thin; knowledge has ONE home.
- **Batch fan-out** — `haipipe-task-batch` skill + Workflow `pipeline` (`batch-pipeline.workflow.js`): N typed specs in one session, each flowing author → GATE 1 → run → GATE 2 independently; GPU-safe (`autoRun` default off).
- **Notebook policy** — `_meta.notebook: full | thin | off` knob in `run-sh-template.sh`; heavy compute (training/data) defaults to `thin`; `notebooks/` + `_WorkSpace/` default-gitignored. → see [skills/B_project/CHANGELOG.md](skills/B_project/CHANGELOG.md)
- **Per-run quality moved C ← D** — the per-run sanity checklist now lives with `run-result-auditor-agent` (C_task GATE 2); `D_probe review run` delegates. → see [skills/D_probe/CHANGELOG.md](skills/D_probe/CHANGELOG.md)
- **D_probe agent families (lighter pattern)** — `reviewers/` (structural + integrity-Codex + claim-Codex) and `advancers/` (explorer). Deliberately NO `creators/`: D_probe's builders stay interactive skills (probe design needs steering; no type axis; parallelism is downstream in C_task). The same builder≠judge method, applied to a low-volume deliberate layer. → see [skills/D_probe/CHANGELOG.md](skills/D_probe/CHANGELOG.md)

### Layer changelogs touched this release
- [C_task](skills/C_task/CHANGELOG.md) — agents, skill renames, dual-mode, batch, notebook knob
- [D_probe](skills/D_probe/CHANGELOG.md) — per-run checklist delegated to C_task; bridge dispatch
- [B_project](skills/B_project/CHANGELOG.md) — notebook retention + gitignore guidance
